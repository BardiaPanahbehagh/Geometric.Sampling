Using this package, geometric sampling (GFS) can be implemented with three functions:

GFSfixedsize: for GFS fixed size with design entropy control capability,
GFSoptimal:   for optimal GFS sampling, by searching many designs and choosing the best among them.
GFSsteam:     for sampling the GFS stream, with window size control and design entropy control.
